# 你好！

I'm building things that try to make the world better for humans. [我们地球上就一辈子，卷来的小钱真的值得自豪吗?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWjTb9CtkxM)

I was a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego studying Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls with undergrad degrees in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of (discrete and numerical) math and computer science with applications in robotics.
