# 你好！

I'm building things that try to make the world better for humans. [我们地球上就一辈子，卷来的小钱真的值得自豪吗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWjTb9CtkxM)？

I was a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego studying intelligent systems with undergrad degrees in computer engineering and mathematics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, particularly (linear) algebra, and computer science -- with special interest in robotics and machine learning.
